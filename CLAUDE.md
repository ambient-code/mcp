# Self-Review Protocol

Before presenting your work:

1. Re-read your output as if you're a code reviewer
2. Check for:
   - Missing edge cases
   - Security issues (injection, validation, secrets)
   - Incomplete reasoning
   - Assumptions that should be stated
3. Fix any issues found
4. Only then present to user

If you found and fixed issues, briefly note: "Self-review: Fixed [issue]"
